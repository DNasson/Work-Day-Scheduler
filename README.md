# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

User Story
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

The workday scheduler project was built to allow someone with a busy schedule to not only see the things they have going on during their workday, but can visually recognize where they are in that day. The motivation behind this project is users that work better with lists because this application will allow them to save what tasks they have each hour and those will stay in their schedule once they refresh the page. The color coding to signify the past, present and future is a feature for those that need a visual represention of where they are in the day. 

I learned how to use less repetition in my work so that the code looks cleaner. I learned that trial and error can be the best way to figure out what is not working on a issue: only certain parts of the color coding would work so I debugged and found the way that it works.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

The user will start on a page that has time blocks for all of the hours between 9am and 5pm. They will add meetings or plans for each hour that they require and press the save button at the end of the row to save the data. The input will remain even when the page is refreshed. The timeblocks are also color coded: gray means that the time is in the past for that day, red means the current hour and green represents what will be in future hours.
